Developed a web application that takes a YouTube video URL as
 input and enables users to ask questions or generate summaries
 based on the video's transcript using Large Language Models
 (LLMs).
Extracted video transcripts using the youtube_transcript_api,
 and processed them through text chunking to handle longer
 transcripts within token limits.
 • Built an intuitive Streamlit interface for video input, chat-based
 Q&A, and dynamic summarization output.
 • Demonstrated practical use cases for content summarization,
 lecture review, meeting recaps, and edtech assistants.
 • Enabled users to understand long videos in minutes, improving
 learning speed and retention for educational content by over
 60%.
